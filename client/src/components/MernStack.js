                            MERN stack is the name given to a set of JavaScript based technologies used in developing web applications. MERN is the acronym name given to the set of technologies including Mongo DB, Express JS, React JS/ Redux and Node JS. Among these technologies Mongo DB is a database system, Node JS is a back-end runtime environment, Express JS is a back-end web framework and React is a front-end framework.

                                                MongoDB is an open source database management system (DBMS) that uses a document-oriented database model which supports various forms of data.

                                                Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

                                                The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server, meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the backend part of the MEAN stack, together with Mongo DB database and AngularJS frontend framework.

                                                React (also known as React.js or React JS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

                                                React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.

                                                <strong>Redux</strong> is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to (and inspired by) Facebook's Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.

                                                Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser.
                                            </p>
                                            <p style={{ color: "#333", fontSize: "1.3rem" }}>
                                                Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.
